# Objects' classification
All object properties and types

This repository trys to document ALL the object technical types available in all the languages and frameworks.
By 'technical type' I mean not concrete fields/props, but technical implementation properties and tricks and architecture patterns and anti-patterns.

The list itself is more descriptive than this doc.
